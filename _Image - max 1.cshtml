@*
  This page is just an entry point for your code. It will do the following:
  1. Check if it can detect the CSS framework used by the theme
    - if yes, it will use that
    - otherwise it will fallback to assume it's bootstrap 4 = "bs4"
    - note that the BS4 edition has an additional check for unknown frameworks
  2. Then it will load the real cshtml-template from the matching edition-folder
