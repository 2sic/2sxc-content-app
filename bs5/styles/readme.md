# SASS / SCSS Files to Generate CSS

These files generate the final CSS for bootstrap 5.

If you want to customize the CSS, you will usually follow the ["Create Custom Styles in a Standard 2sxc App" checklist](https://azing.org/2sxc/r/gg_aB9FD)

Bootstrap 5 uses CSS variables for colors for example, so you can easily change the colors in the `theme/theme.css` file, without compiling. For more information, see our ["documentation"](https://go.2sxc.org/app-theme)
