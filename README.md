## Purpose
Each DNN portal using [2sxc][2sxc] has a section called "Content" which contains the main content-types and main templates. 
This could be initialized manually, but in most cases it's more efficient to install a set of best-practice content-types and templates. To ensure this stuff looks good, these content-types and templates should be optimized to the CSS-framework in use. 

This package **Content-Bootstrap3** is the default configuration package which 2sxc offers for Bootstrap installations.
